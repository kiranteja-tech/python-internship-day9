# Task 9: Exception Handling & Logging

## 📌 Overview
This task demonstrates how to handle runtime errors in Python using exception handling and how to log errors using the logging module.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- logging module

## 📂 Files Included
- `error_handling.py` → Python script for exception handling and logging
- `error.log` → Log file storing error details
- `README.md` → Task documentation

## ✅ Features Implemented
- try-except blocks
- Handling multiple exceptions
- else and finally blocks
- Logging errors to a file
- Custom exception creation
- Runtime error simulation
- Debugging using logs

## ❓ Interview Questions & Answers

### Why exception handling?
To prevent program crashes and handle errors gracefully.

### try vs except?
- try: code that may raise an error
- except: handles the error

### What is logging?
Recording application errors and events in a file for debugging and monitoring.

### finally block usage?
Executes regardless of whether an exception occurs.

### Custom exceptions?
User-defined exceptions created using the `Exception` class.

## 🎯 Learning Outcome
This task helped me understand how to write production-ready Python code with proper error handling and logging.

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python error_handling.py
